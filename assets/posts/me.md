> What do you do in the face of fear?

Hi! My name is Sean. Let me tell you about my day.

I woke up groggy. I guess that's my normal. Consistently sleeping for less than 6 hours for the last few years will do that to a man. I lay in bed wishing to go back to sleep - knowing it's not going to happen. There are at least 4 reasons why I'm not going to back to sleep. It's a good thing they are cute.

I convince myself that I should get out of bed. Better pull out my phone first and see if anything important is going on. Just as I expected -- nothing. Fine. I'll still waste a few minutes catching up on low-meaning slack posts.

"Da!?"

The 1 year old jars me from my melancholy. Inwardly I groan, putting my phone away as she obliviously launchs herself into my arms. Such a simple life. No wonder she can have such enthusiasm and jubilance. When her needs are met, she's happy and exploring. Learning. Growing. Doing the best she can do to become better each day. Failure doesn't deter her. She just learns and improves

Alright I'm up. Read "Beware of Pride" for a couple of minutes. Pray about things that are important to me. "How am I doing as a spouse?" "How am I doing as a Dad?" Not that I was distracted by thinking about the job I don't like. Or the kids yelling in the background. I'm so focused.

Take a shower. Kids all want to shower too. Actually one wants a bath. And needs some minor medical treatment after. Cool cool cool. Time to make breakfast. Eh. Time to clean the kitchen becuase we didn't do that last night. Kids went to bed late. Again. Oh! We have some leftover pancakes! Thanks Courtney :) Courtney is cleaning the kitchen. I notice the sourdough bagels are still on the counter.

> Do you think those bagels are still good? Not sure how long they've been out.

Overly worked and underappreciated wife who is cleaning up the kitchen responds as loving as possible. "I haven't gotten to it yet and this kitchen is driving me crazy. I'll get there as soon as I can."

Understanding smashes me in the side of the head. What a flippant thing to have said. Of course she's doing the very best she can. My casual tone changes to empathy. "Here, I'll work on the dishes so you can work on those bagels." _Connection. We need that_. We smile at each other. At least briefly. "Daaad! I'm hungry". "Da!? Da!?". Alright. Do the dishes. Get the kids food. Let the 1 year old "help" with loading the dishes.

I should work. sigh. Don't want to be here. I'll apply for jobs. Watch a YouTube video. Listen to a Dave Ramsey podcast. Respond to slack messages. Check my email.

> Bagels turned out!

Woot! Good news :)
